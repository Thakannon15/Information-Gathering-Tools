# Wireshark Walkthrough Tutorial for College Students on Kali Linux

## Introduction

Welcome to the Wireshark Walkthrough Tutorial for Kali Linux! This tutorial is crafted for college students and cybersecurity enthusiasts looking to explore Wireshark, a powerful network protocol analyzer. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of installing Wireshark on your Kali Linux system and demonstrate its basic usage for network analysis.

## Step 1: Open Terminal

Open the terminal on your Kali Linux system. You can do this by clicking on the terminal icon or using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

## Step 2: Update Package Lists

Ensure your system has the latest information about available packages by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

## Step 3: Install Wireshark

Install Wireshark using the package manager:

```bash
sudo apt install wireshark
```

During the installation, you will be prompted to allow non-superusers to capture packets. Choose 'Yes' to grant Wireshark this capability.

## Step 4: Add User to Wireshark Group

To capture packets without superuser privileges, add your user to the `wireshark` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG wireshark $USER
```

You may need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

## Step 5: Verify Installation

Verify that Wireshark has been successfully installed by running:

```bash
wireshark --version
```

This command should display information about the installed Wireshark version.

## Basic Wireshark Usage

Now that Wireshark is installed, let's explore its basic usage for network analysis. Here are a few examples:

### 5.1 Start Wireshark

Open Wireshark by typing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
wireshark
```

This will launch the Wireshark graphical interface.

### 5.2 Select Network Interface

Choose the network interface you want to capture packets from using the dropdown menu in the Wireshark interface.

### 5.3 Start Capturing Packets

Click on the "Start" button to begin capturing packets on the selected interface.

### 5.4 Stop Capturing Packets

To stop the packet capture, click on the "Stop" button.

### 5.5 Analyze Captured Packets

Explore the captured packets in the main Wireshark window. You can filter, search, and analyze packets based on various criteria.

### 5.6 Save Capture

Save the captured packets to a file for later analysis:

- File -> Save As...

## Step 6: Example Usage

Let's put our knowledge into action with an example:

```bash
# Start Wireshark
wireshark

# Select network interface
# Start capturing packets
# Stop capturing packets

# Analyze captured packets
# Save capture for later analysis
```

Feel free to explore additional features and customize your packet analysis based on your specific needs. Wireshark is a versatile tool for in-depth network examination on your Kali Linux system.

## Conclusion
